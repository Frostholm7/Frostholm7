- 👋 Hi, I’m @Frostholm7
- 👀 I'm interested in taking good care of my wife, so she doesn't get mad that I'm behind a screen again.
Joking aside, now I'm retired. I have worked for monny with development for 40+ years.
I have written family web site in almost every type of system offered.
- 🌱 I am currently learning a lot of Joomla. There is still life in me. My approach is that a good day is one where I have learned something new. And luckily there is a lot that can be learned now. Unfortunately, there are many who do not learn from earlier lessons. Both within IT and life.
- 💞️ As a professional, I have written code to make systems work together. My former colleagues laughed and said that the only thing I didn't use was carrier pigeons, I used everything else.
- 📫 Right now I'm using www.koonsoftware.com to try out my Joomla stuff.
- Right now this GitHub account should be used to participate in testing joomla, it's a good way to learn something new. (And pay back with thanks for borrowing joomla for many years)
